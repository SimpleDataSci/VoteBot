## OpenDataBeta
As a civic tech fellow, with funding from the Harvard Graduate School of Design Community Service Fellowship, I developed a suite of software tools for strengthening municipal civic engagement in collaboration with City Councillor Nadeem Mazen and his design firm, Nimblebot. We did intensive user research with civil society organizations and ultimately created tools that allow them to easily pull data from government websites and deliver it to their constituencies via inexpensive, low-touch, high-engagement channels, such as SMS, with almost no technical volunteer labor.

VoteBot was designed to be easily adapted and deployed for free on heroku.
